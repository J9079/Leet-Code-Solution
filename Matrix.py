# Question 1
# Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/
# Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
# Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Note:
# A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
# Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
# Example 1:
# Input: board =
# [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
# ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
# ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
# ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
# ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
# ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
# ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
# ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
# ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
# Output: true



# Question 2
# Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix
# Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.
# Example 1:
# Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
# Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]


# Question 3
# Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image
# You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
# You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
# Example 1:
# Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
# Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
